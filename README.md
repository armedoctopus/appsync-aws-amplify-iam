# AppSync GraphQL Web App with AWS Amplify and IAM Authentication

Blog: [sandny.com](http://sandny.com/appsync-graphql-amplify-iam/)

Howdy! In this tutorial going to create an AppSync GraphQL Web App with AWS Amplify and IAM Authentication using Cognito User Pools. The reason behind this is, if you are creating an web app quickly, the AWS AppSync, Mobile Hub, DynamoDB will come with all the equipments that you need to scale it. So this is such an attempt but um not using the aws amplify cli to create since I would like to know what my configurations looks like when it comes to web. The App will be a react app to quickly show how its done.
